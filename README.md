## Setup

Download the latest [clipster.apk](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Android/releases/latest/download/clipster.apk) release to your Android device. Make sure you can run third-party apps on your device. Check the "Security" tab or listing within your Settings menu. Normally itâ€™ll say allow third-party installations or install from unknown sources.  

## Usage

On the first run, register a new account. The credentials are saved on your device.  
To share a text in the cloud with your devices, long-press and share it to `Clipster`.  
To get a text that was shared from one of your devices, select `Get Clip`. Then, it is in your local clipboard and you can paste it.
